  I'm the one on the left in the photo above :D!

  My name Yao. Growing up I've lived in 5 countries, a total of three continents. 

  I am currently pursuing an MSc in Mathematics and Foundations of Computer Science at the University of Oxford. Previously, I graduated with a BSc in Mathematics and Computer Science in Ã‰cole Polytechnique (l'X) in Paris. My cohort was probably the my amazing group of people I've met. As a regularly curious person, I'm passionate about democratizing education and learning. I've dabbled around with research in network analysis in supply chain reconstruction, transformer image segmentation and NLP, combinatorics, and high-performance computing for distributed Machine Learning. 

  Besides my work in mathematics and computer science, I enjoy playing in the orchestra and volleyball. I can get quite competitive for the latter but I've also coached volleyball in my highschool. I'm quite a diversely curious person. I love great conversations with strangers, travel, photography, and literature from various languages. Feel free to contact me on LinkedIn or fill the contact form!
