I'm the one on the left in the photo :D!

My name Yi Yao Tan. I usually go by Yao since I was young. Growing up I've lived in 5 countries, a total of three continents and I'm quite a diversely curious person for better or for worse.

I am currently pursuing an MSc in Mathematics and Foundations of Computer Science at the University of Oxford. Previously I graduated with a BSc in Mathematics and Computer Science in Ã‰cole Polytechnique (l'X) in Paris. My cohort was absolutely phenomenal.  My interests include Probability, Networks, and Machine Learning. I have extensive research experience in network analysis in supply chain reconstruction, transformer image segmentation, combinatorics, and high-performance computing. 

Besides my work in mathematics and computer science, I enjoy playing in the orchestra and volleyball. I can get quite competitive for the latter but I've also coached volleyball in my highschool. I love great conversations with strangers, travel, photography, and literature from various languages. Feel free to contact me on LinkedIn or fill the contact form!
