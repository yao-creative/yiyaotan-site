  My name is Yao. Growing up, I've lived in 5 countries, a total of three continents. 

  I've recently finished a MSc in Mathematics and Foundations of Computer Science at the University of Oxford working in the Complexity Economics group led by Doyne Farmer (Inventor of the first wearable computer, founder of the Prediction Company, and Econo-physicist) and supervised by Renaud Lambiotte (Network Community Detection Researcher - Louvain Method). Previously, I graduated with a BSc in Mathematics and Computer Science in Ã‰cole Polytechnique (l'X) in Paris. My cohort was probably the most amazing group of people I've met. I previously also did research in Huawei creating their sparse distributed attention library for NLP and Image Segmentation and Classification in the framework Mindspore.
  
  As a regularly curious person, I'm also passionate about democratizing acess to opportunity, continual learning, communication theory, languages, and inter/intra-personal psychology. I've dabbled around with research in network analysis in supply chain reconstruction, transformer image segmentation and NLP, combinatorics, high-performance computing for distributed Machine Learning, and clustering analysis of cancer related proteins (CDK2). 

  Besides my work in mathematics and computer science, I enjoy playing in the orchestra and volleyball. At Oxford I the flute for played for Hertford and Turl Street Orchestras. For volleyball, I've played for University Oxford Blues team and Penang State back in Malaysia with a silver in the national U21 competition. I've also coached middle school and highschool volleyball and enjoy teaching. I enjoy great conversations with strangers, travel, photography, and literature from various languages. 

  I'm vegetarian which I believe is important to me as it helps me make conscious decisions about my health and what I consume on a daily basis. In my free time enjoy listening to music, often classical but other times diverse such as italian rap or japanese city pop. I also listen to a lot of podcasts and short book summaries mostly on philosophy (Camus, Walter Benjamin, Sean Kelly), history, and some scifi fiction (Asimov), magical realism (Murakami), poetry (Khalil Gibran). You can also find me crashing at my friends' places in different subcontinents, I spent 110 days on the couch/ air-mattress in 4 countries last year.
