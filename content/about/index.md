  I'm the one on the left in the photo above :D!

  My name is Yao. Growing up, I've lived in 5 countries, a total of three continents. 

  I've recently finished a MSc in Mathematics and Foundations of Computer Science at the University of Oxford. Previously, I graduated with a BSc in Mathematics and Computer Science in Ã‰cole Polytechnique (l'X) in Paris. My cohort was probably the most amazing group of people I've met. As a regularly curious person, I'm also passionate about personalizing, democratizing education, acess to opportunity, and learning, and also breaking knowledge barriers. I've dabbled around with research in network analysis in supply chain reconstruction, transformer image segmentation and NLP, combinatorics, and high-performance computing for distributed Machine Learning. 

  Besides my work in mathematics and computer science, I enjoy playing in the orchestra and volleyball. At Oxford I the flute for played for Hertford and Turl Street Orchestras. When I was 17 I performed my first solo in front of 500 people and also won a silver medal in the U21 national volleyball championship in Malaysia. I've also coached middle school and highschool volleyball and enjoy teaching. I'm quite a diversely curious person. I enjoy great conversations with strangers, travel, photography, and literature from various languages. 

  My languages: I've known English and Mandarin bilingually since I was young. I taught myself from zero to full working proficiency in French in 4 months (enough to read Camus, play in a sports team, talk machine learning researchers, and even go on dates! ;P). Then I studied 2 years of Russian in French during my Undergraduate. I know a bit of Italian to joke around con gli zii (my teammates) quando giochiamo a pallavolo in Oxford and in Rome. At one point I tried to learn to pronounce basic devenagri/ Hindi script but I annoyed my friend trying to read every single sign possible in Jaipur. I used to get by with Swedish in supermarkets thanks to my half-Swedish cousin and bits of Japanese, but I no longer claim to understand both. I'm currently learning Indonesian/ Malay so back to my roots. 

  I believe that one's cognitive experience of meaning starts from the expressivity of the mind and the ability to put names and nuances to feelings, events, ideas, and thoughts. Thus by learning languages, and reading by natural extension, we fundamentally change the way we think, understanding nuances, meaning, ourselves, and the world. This understanding leads to embracing heterogeneity, and also builds a more robust, comprehensive and precise framework for thought, reasoning, and literal behavior. I say this in a philosophical and bio-psychological sense because literal neuralogical rewirings and thickening of myelin sheaths building a more robust mind to process the way we interact with ourselves and the world.
  
  Aside from that, I'm vegetarian which I believe is important to me as it helps me make conscious decisions about my health and what I consume on a daily basis. In my free time enjoy listening to music, often classical but other times diverse such as italian rap or japanese city pop. I also listen to a lot of podcasts and short book summaries mostly on philosophy (Camus, Walter Benjamin, Sean Kelly), history, and some scifi fiction (Asimov), magical realism (Murakami), poetry (Khalil Gibran). You can also find me crashing at my friend's places in different subcontinents, I spent 110 days on the couch/ air-mattress in 4 countries this year.
