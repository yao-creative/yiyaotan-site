  I'm the one on the left in the photo above :D!

  My name Yao. Growing up I've lived in 5 countries, a total of three continents. 

  I am currently pursuing an MSc in Mathematics and Foundations of Computer Science at the University of Oxford. Previously, I graduated with a BSc in Mathematics and Computer Science in Ã‰cole Polytechnique (l'X) in Paris. My cohort was probably the most amazing group of people I've met. As a regularly curious person, I'm passionate about personalizing and democratizing education and learning and also breaking knowledge barriers. I've dabbled around with research in network analysis in supply chain reconstruction, transformer image segmentation and NLP, combinatorics, and high-performance computing for distributed Machine Learning. 

  Besides my work in mathematics and computer science, I enjoy playing in the orchestra and volleyball. At Oxford I played for Hertford and Turl Street Orchestras. I can get quite competitive for volleyball, but I've also coached middle school and highschool volleyball and love teaching. I'm quite a diversely curious person. I love great conversations with strangers, travel, photography, and literature from various languages. I speak Mandarin and English natively, I've a working level of French (enough to go on dates :P), studied a couple years of Russian, and now on an Italian duolingo streak of almost a year. Feel free to contact me on LinkedIn or fill the contact form!
