I created a null model to replicate the network topology of Hungarian and Ecuadorian fine-grained (corporate-level) Input-Output Network Statics using topology induced by statistical ensembles distributed on a Poincar√© Disk since they have been shown to exhibit real world network topology hard to recreate in basic random graph ensembles.

I used capulas to create powerlaw joint in and out degree distributions of the nodes.
