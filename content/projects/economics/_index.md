This section contains my projects related to Complexity Economics.

I spent 8 months with Complexity Economics Seminar held by Doyne Farmer, a group trying to simulate economics from the bottom up through heterogenous entities embedded on mathematical networks to gather emergent properties. They use statistical physics and real world data to stress test economies and challenge some macro economic theories.

Doyne Farmer is known for studying early Chaotic Dynamics and also invented the first wearable computer in the 1980s to game casinos in Las Vegas.

Other notable researchers: Jean-Philippe Bouchaud (Polytechnique) who was named quant of the year. Stefan Thurner who leads the Complexity Science Hub in Vienna with two PhDs in Physics and Economics.
