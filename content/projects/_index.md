Above: Random Plane tree generation with 10000 nodes (Random Generation of Catalan Counted Simulations)

Welcome to my project portfolio. Here you will find detailed descriptions of my work in various fields. 

A quick guide, my main projects have been:

1) Sparse Transformer Attention and Visual Image Transformer Segmentation
2) Supply Chain Reconstruction using Hyperbolic Network Geometry
3) CDK-2 Protein Conformation Clustering
