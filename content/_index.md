# Welcome!

I'm Yao, a postgraduate student passionate about Mathematics and Computer Science. Here you'll find my projects, research work, and thoughts on various topics.

Pictured above: Spring in Oxford!

The pictures from each section and landing pages on this website I've either taken or is from one of my projects, usually captioned on the page. Perhaps for book reviews and more abstract concepts in the blog some pictures are borrowed.
