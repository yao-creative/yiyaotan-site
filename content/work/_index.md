I'm currently working on my startup as CTO, since October 2024, in the Creator Industry, interested in recommendation systems, pricing mechanisms, and AI architectures. In the midst of the craziness, good things come when we figure out complicate things, and the world is always growing.

They say you can tell a lot about a person by the type of content they consume.

# Some random theories I have relating to my work:

0. If I were to generalize: the role of the entrepreneur would be to make the world a bigger place for people. But admittedly this isn't measurable, but perhaps measuring revealed preferences is an easier way. Most other goals and values are valid but are approximating metrics with incomplete mutual information with point or sometimes multi-step abstracted but relevant. 

1. Small world's is nature's way of self organization, information efficiency with energy constraints through heterogeneous and dynamic systems. Balances the growth of the collective as knowledge/ information compounds, with locality bias for innovation. Gossip Protocols, Pandemic Spread, Economic Transactions, Brain Pathways,Supply Chains, Sparse Transformers.

2. Software is an abstraction of point 1 as its the fastest mode of information transfer. Even LLMs in their information compression which is what makes them so attractive.

3. Well designed Monetary mechanisms are problem-oriented-optimization-efficient as they provide continous approximation of human preferences (Voting Systems, Arrow's impossibility theorem and relaxations). Which is why businesses processes, decisions and innovation moves exponentially faster than governments. Although with fuzzy objectives, I'm not as sure. Their pitfall is their incentives dependent on their business model /vision where everything else is optimized on. Innately they can only be pseudometrics and have to be locally biased due to the fundamental constraints of local incomplete information of preferences and chaotic nature of society. Also necessary to build comparative advantage for better margins. First principles thinking is a linguistic way approximate this.

4. B2B Economic transactions are highly anchored on "comparative advantage" priced on disassortativity on a heterogenous topology that every individual or company is embedded in a larger world with elasticity function of search speed. Want - can achieve or have ~ provider profit.

5. Locality bias of the tech-entrepreneur's belief of what to work-on is what builds the differential gap of value between the customer and the service/ value they receive.

6. Businesses who accurately approximate the value they bring into the market are more stable. Those with inaccurate business models or serve for max arbitrage over short term attract competition or regulation. Thinking Amazon and Stripe counter intuitive pricing to traditional short-term profit maximizing. This includes both business model and continuous innovation for the consumer in the market. But due to the locality of information and finiteness of compute we can only try our best. Squeeze the market and one attracts enemies, tracking the growing the market brings stability and passive revenue. 

7. History rhymes but never repeats itself because physical laws are constant. Human-societal behavior has patterns causes ergodicity. Absolute position is time and path dependent. History is a function of itself and so are societal reactions.

8. Arbitrage is just local optimization over information asymmetry. Technology speeds up how information is transfered: books, telegraph, cameras, phone, television, computers, duplication of pdfs, internet, websearch, mobile phones, increasingly robust stock market for price discovery, and LLMs. More importantly, society has a bias towards speeding up this information diffusion. Thus technology smoothens these asymmetries in society and democratizes access, causing for more efficient innovation and more accurate tracking of societal progress, with a caveat that these two processes are fuzzy and stochastic.

9. Actions and reactions the only things fully controllable by the conscious mind, perhaps understanding them and optimizing the hell out of these crazy metrics is what drives people far.

10. Economic complexity is the ultimate end game that niches get nicher due to specialization for economic margins, development is compounding or exponential, power laws get longer. Perhaps to topology of innovation grows hyperbolicly if the world's knowledge could be described in a geometric figure like a Poincar√© disk.

11. Perhaps in a world of generative AI, in 2025 and onwards, that the world's knowledge is expanding at an exponential rate, the bringing value for creativity embracing continous learning. Creating things from pure imagination which you'd not think possible. Perhaps that's the fun of it :D.

For reference, I don't think "AI Agent" is a buzzword just because of the card above, Ivan Zhao is an interesting philosopher entrepreneur. I think AI agents are tools, necessary but not ultimate just like all the other layers of technology we've built on top of throughout all of human history.
