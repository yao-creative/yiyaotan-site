## This year in brief

Today I start a period of indefinite homelessness, staying at a friend's place at Oxford, in a couple weeks with another friend in Hanover, perhaps beginning of September in Estonia, and then back for my thesis defense mid-September and then to who knows where else. Perhaps this is the sort of thing you embrace at 23.

Recently, I've been finishing up my thesis for Master's degree in Mathematics and Foundations of Computer Science at Oxford. Writing about [supply chain topology](/projects/economics/supply-chain-reconstruction/). It's been a year which has been a bit chaotic but full of turns and unquantifiable lessons about life. For starters I entered thinking I'd want to do theoretical computer science, ended up trying to enter the economics and statistical physics sphere with neither a degree in economics and statistical physics but crashing courses in Oxford's Physics department with friends I've met in volleyball. Approximately 20 interviews, around 200 job applications from machine learning engineering to quant research and no clear path ahead. 

Sometimes I feel as if I'm a square-peg trying to fit into society's round hole of the job-market-- dabbled with machine learning in tech, bioinformatics, and now economics and physics? I've even been rejected from the math-physics professor I work in Networks which I've recently started my thesis with, however, I think I've gained some of his respect from sneaking into Chaos Theory and Nonlinear Dynamics classes and an original theoretical computer scientist to be. Perhaps it's also just part being in our 20's. I believe that there are two types of people in the world those who know what they want to do and are deeply passionate about it and those who are still in the constant yet natural struggle of figuring out what they want to do with their skills. Deep down, I believe that perhaps it comes to the idea of "agency." We want to find work where we believe that we chose it ourselves and it's our true passion, something which unifies our values and interests and where we can feel valued all together. 

## Passions vs Sunk-Cost

Another caveat is that often times we misconstrue what we believe to be our interests and values with what we've done or our background and are afraid to venture a little further and explore: for example me-- an identity of being a researcher-- which I've been my whole academic life and spent a good amount of time sulking over in a degree identity crisis this year. Perhaps it is the sunk-cost-fallacy mindset and where I've been afraid to make a decision and embrace a jump to try something new like start-ups which I might be better suited for. One way I personally address myself on this is that the longer the wait the inverse happens where the wasted time and energy cost actually only grows.
