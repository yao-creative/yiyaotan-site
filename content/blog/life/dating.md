Often we wonder who to date, will they be my life partner, why is dating so hard in our 20s and 30s. The short answer is there's no perfect matching for everyone on both sides, but most people don't exactly understand their preferences anyways.

# [Gale–Shapley's Stable Matching Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gale–Shapley_algorithm) as a Null Model

Gale–Shapley's Stable Matching Problem serves as a reasonable null model with the most generic assumptions on the population (the large majority I'd be addressing). Firstly, assumes two same-sized sets of binary gender each oriented towards the opposite gender and each individual knows exactly their preference ranking of the opposite gender in a discrete sense, maximal self information. For simplicity we write M and F as these binary gender sets.

## Implications in Dating
We often site the fundamental result is that it shows that a stable matching exists such cheating will never be two-way consensual (any pair of non M-F couples will prefer each other at the sametime). 

Perhaps a more fundamental implication for life can be studied in the way the optimal solution was constructed. The proposing side given enough time to propose will reach an optimality of their preferences and always reach the same stable matching regardless of the order of proposal (one which is best for all proposers and worst for all proposées). Hence at scale it'd mean that if proposers could keep on proposing and pairs can keep changing no one by pretending to propose to one of the opposite gender then the other to game, and also the process with terminate finitely every time with the same matching.

Assuming that people at minimum new what they liked and wanted the best outcome for them, those with high agency would find the partner of their higher preferences rather than if they were passive perhaps to the effect of the worst stable outcome for the passive.

Perhaps this is why:

1) Dating apps like to say "We've found that being the most 'yourself' on your dating profile" leads to the best outcomes.

2) Don't play-games has a fundamental mathematical grounding. Exploiting information asymmetry in games are don't work as well if the person you're pairing with has access to other options (elasticity of dating apps).

3) You should be confident to swipe right and not just wait on those who find you even if you think you're lucky.

4) But also there could just be no perfect matching even if they knew everything in dating apps so get swiping and stop blaming them, they're just tools increase your self-optimizing market efficiency.


## Other Implications 

Some other thoughts I had about life:

1) In Meta's internal research they found it optimal that being accurate in their open positions led to more optimal self-selecting outcomes.

2) People with self adjancency often find themselves in better places in society.

3) Emotional Intelligence, self consciousness, knowing yourself and exactly what you want leads to more optimal outcomes.

4) For consumer niche companies such as platforms, it's important that they have a single business model serving a single side: Meta, Google are all B2B. Focus on a niche 

# Poisson

Ok perhaps the null model above is a large simplification of the process of matching. Most often
