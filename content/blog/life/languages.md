I've known English and Mandarin bilingually since I was young and also understood Hokkien to converse with the older generation. I taught myself from zero to full working proficiency in French in 4 months (enough to read Camus, play in a sports team, talk machine learning researchers, and even go on dates! ;P). Then I studied 2 years of Russian in French during my Undergraduate. I know a bit of Italian to joke around con gli zii (my teammates) quando giochiamo a pallavolo in Oxford and in Rome. I've tried to learn to pronounce basic devenagri/ Hindi script, annoying my friend trying to read every single sign possible in Jaipur. I used to get by with Swedish in supermarkets thanks to my half-Swedish cousin and bits of Japanese, but I no longer claim to understand both. I'm currently learning Indonesian/ Malay so back to my roots. I've a spaghetti of words in my head these days, but if you have good book recommendations to help me ease into any of these languages I'd be interested : D.

I believe that one's cognitive experience of meaning starts from the expressivity of the mind and the ability to put names and nuances to feelings, events, ideas, and thoughts. Thus by learning languages, and reading by natural extension, we fundamentally change the way we think, understanding nuances, meaning, ourselves, and the world. This understanding leads to embracing heterogeneity, and also builds a more robust, comprehensive and precise framework for thought, reasoning, and literal behavior. I say this in a philosophical and bio-psychological sense because literal neuralogical rewirings and thickening of myelin sheaths building a more robust mind to process the way we interact with ourselves and the world.
