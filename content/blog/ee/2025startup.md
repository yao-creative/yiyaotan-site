Status: in-construction (Sept 2025)

2025 seems to have brought a lot of confusion to the way tech builds startups. Perhaps vibe-coding and automation has made us re-question the need for technical founders. The short answer is no, nothing much has changed. Perhaps the exact action the what and what has, but the technicality of engineering has always been a universal constant. Perhaps it's shifted into deeper tech or more AI/ML based engineering and not the tradition apps that was true to be so 5 years ago. 

Perhaps 2025 just meant definition of startup has changed. The technical will always have a comparative advantage over the non and to build any moat. "Startup" is always something hard for it's time, doing something a normal person can do perhaps means it's a 2025 business. Technology also pays premium over the frontiers like Nvidia, OpenAI etc... The ordinal rule of economics is transaction is measured by opportunity costs, comparative advantage not absolute productivity, thus the tackling of the difficult is a universal constant.

If a non technical can build and MVP than perhaps it's just a product not a startup. That being said, what makes a startup decent at the MVP stage doesn't mean it'll keep being the best moving forward, the whole thing is a process. First, eg: copilot, doesn't guarantee future profits, it's continuously being on the edge. Apps perhaps aren't the definition of startup any more Satya Nadella mentioned CRUD is no longer the "thing" to go for, very early on in this race.

Any large major technology company has always had some algorithmic or infrastructure edge, even down to Google founded about 30 years ago. Otherwise they're partially design driven like Linear and Notion, however, the problem of this is that visual taste doesn't always appeal to everyone. Nonetheless YC has been searching for this in 2025.

I'll believe that the core principles of startup, which have never changed. That's assuming that agree that the subject real less than 1% world movers edge of the long tailed distribution.

Name any successful product from this given category we talk about and one can always pinpoint almost exactly something they do relatively better than everyone. Try this: for any of you subscriptions or products you use personally free and especially paid, personal or entreprise, you can say "I use X because of Y."

# Principles 

## A Startup is a Process

YC talks about this, execution not just idea. Simply put, companies are dynamic and markets are, and that's naturally healthy positive-sum capitalism. A startup is a continual process, what makes on startup good right now doesn't guarantee future profits. Google and Meta led the AI/ ML industry before the 2020s, infinite resources never dictated the win due to allocation and underestimation of other domains. OpenAI was cutting edge in 2022, it still is but Anthropic seemed to have taken on coding 2024-2025. Github was a big aha moment for me when I first tried it in 2022, it didn't guarantee any edge over Cursor.


## Why People Matter

Mathematically, if startups are a process of constant innovation and being on the edge, in 1968, Lee Kuan Yew visited Harvard on a sabbatical, he realized this fact and made textile and then manufacturing all stepping stones of Singapore's economy in 1970s and 1990s transitions respectively. If we think of the actions a startup takes as a sum individuals represented by Markov decision processes with new states. The only universally controllable common prior behind every action/ change is the person hired. They might be self-evolving themselves, that's a contextual caveat, but picking the correct one for the process. But also by observation almost all of the most successful startups without fail were spawned out of the most talented cofounding teams, by universality it's probably an assumed bare minimum. The Paypal Mafia, OpenAI, the fabled "Google Engineer" etc. just to name a few.


There's an interesting interview between [Huberman -- Marc Andressen](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0qkK5lNuRFJq0o11Js5Hvl) which highlights the traits of good founders in a concise manner: self-conscious, disagreable, patient, hardworking, and creative. I'd like to add: optimistic and realistic too.



## How to spot technical founders/ or recruit a founding team.

Signaling on their side:

1) Has specific technical opinions/ tastes, taste is developped over time and from doing, the strong and specific tastes signifies that they care or are passionate about it and have experience.

2) Consistent/ large scale projects finished end to end.

3) Reader, similar idea to technical opinions/ tastes, probe the depth of their opinions.

4) Self-reflective in conversations 

5) Constructive conversations, the role of a conversation is solution oriented, they way a founder always moves is upwards.

6) Comfort with directness

7) Draw towards purpose which seems fundamental and meaningful to a human

What a recruiter can do:

1) Conversations, relationship, read if the person writes. 

2) Read concrete history, what they've done exactly the projects and if they're followed through comprehensively (project based hiring, signaling is more accurate the resume based due to abstraction).

3) Learn about their field (20 hour rule) and probe their technical and specific opinions.

4) Self-Improvement. By assortativity of social relationships/ understanding the only way to meet, understand, and retain talent is by growing into this space oneself.

5) Learn about the people they surround themselves with, talent is highly assortative. 

### Tangible Signals Strong Startup Founding:

(Inverse Engineered from Sequoia and YC applications)

1) Unique Market Insight.

2) Unique Technical Insight - Eric Schmidt used to ask each engineer over the new project they were working on this question (more broadly unique insight)

3) Formal / Informal Experience in the field. My intuition is mimimal of 6-8 years of hard presistence or learning before the point of exponential success (needed to achieve points 1 and 2 above). The 10,000 hour rule doesn't lie for the bare minimum of 1 percent outcomes: Reading the success of: Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Warren Buffet by their childhood. Zhang Yiming going from recommendation systems in real estate to social media to Tiktok. (Also from my experience of friends landing quant/ other high paying jobs jobs post bachelors / masters without fail).

4) Innate curiosity and desire to question history and the status quo. The only people who dare to rewrite history is those who question it. One can find this by their reading and writing

5) Intelligence, hard intelligence. One can find hard intelligence through degree signaling through educational experience, multiple second hand recommendations from people who one think are intelligent and trust (aggregate truthful social mechanisms), or project/ work experince (formal or informal). (this one is is a bit more innate).

6) Self-consciousness and world-consciousness: intuition for the tangible knowlable and controllable (Ability to find ordinal direction and clarity in uncertainty, decision space for things to solve is large but focusing on what matters is important). Probably have to talk to them on this or read what they write. 

What if above is hard to collect? Or can't tell? Perhaps resolution to soft signals that they might collect the bare minimum of the 5 above at one point in time due to problem-founder fit coupled with presistence, either the technical or the market issue is interesting to them, visible by well-founded opinions, best case both, that innately this is "them" being themselves to solve. But patience is needed to wait for that. 

How to know if it's the correct thing to wait and bet on? Four simple questions:

1. Does it bring intrinsic value to "human-oriented" society? (Economics is just a web of multi-step transaction of human values, further away, the more abstraction and fuzziness)

2. Is it hard and the technology to do it required is frontier? (Transactions reward comparative advantage)

3. Does it make the world a bigger place? (Arbitraging efficiency of either distribution, law, or operation of other companies; or creating new markets, new opportunities, higher efficiency of old market?)

4. Do you know the **specific** customer base and is solving the problem intrinsically meaning.

The combination of optimizing the hell out of very specifically their uniqueness and the controllable is what can make them successful, comparative advantage again not absolute units of productivity, transactions are by nature disassortative, everyone wants either what they admire or don't have. The price they'd pay can be roughly estimated by the distance between the value and difficulty of obtaining the wanted and the want-er. Find one thing and do it like no one else. Mark Zuckerberg said this to Josh Miller (Arc Broswer) in the Browser Company Podcast.


## Why Vision Matters

If technology solves individual problems, once the process/ product is done with one problem a company has to decide where to go. Vision drives the continuity of innovation. Downstream effects on hiring.

AI transition is confusing if one looks at it from the zeroth order view, no one knows "what" is the future of AI what to develop/ invest.

But first order is more obvious we know we should learn AI related skills because they're frontier.

Second order has never changed, it's why the Stoics have lasted 2000+ years. Positive sum of technology over the long run is consistent. Dale Carnegie's "How to Win Friends and Influence People" is still on the shelves. The value in AI is not in doing but perhaps it's ability to learn and replicate, the value of AI talent is perhaps on teaching it how to meta learn better and better towards specified values. 


# Conclusion
Fundamental behaviors and patterns of the individual and the aggregate of society never changes, there are a few clear constants to navigate by. The rest is understanding nuance. Why do we say history doesn't repeat but rhymes? Situations will never be the same but human behavior and economics is always the same.
