Status: in-construction

2025 seems to have brought a lot of confusion to the way tech builds startups. Perhaps vibe-coding and automation has made us re-question the need for technical founders. The short answer is no, nothing much has changed. Perhaps the exact action the what and what has, but the technicality of engineering has always been a universal constant. Perhaps it's shifted into deeper tech or more AI/ML based engineering and not the tradition apps that was true to be so 5 years ago. 

Perhaps 2025 just meant definition of startup has changed. The technical will always have a comparative advantage over the non and to build any moat. "Startup" is always something hard for it's time, doing something a normal person can do perhaps means it's a 2025 business. Technology also pays premium over the frontiers like Nvidia, OpenAI etc... If a non technical can build and MVP than perhaps it's just a product not a startup. That being said, what makes a startup decent at the MVP stage doesn't mean it'll keep being the best moving forward, the whole thing is a process. First, eg: copilot, doesn't guarantee future profits, it's continuously being on the edge. Apps perhaps aren't the definition of startup any more Satya Nadella mentioned CRUD is no longer the "thing" to go for, very early on in this race.

Any large major technology company has always had some algorithmic or infrastructure edge, even down to Google founded about 30 years ago. Otherwise they're partially driven like Linear and Notion, however, the problem of this is that visual taste doesn't always appeal to everyone. Nonetheless YC has been searching for this in 2025.

We can go back again to the core principles of startup, which have never changed. That's assuming that we agree to be talking about real less than 1% world movers.

# Principles 

## A Startup is a Process

YC talks about this, execution not just idea. Simply put, companies are dynamic and markets are, and that's naturally healthy positive-sum capitalism. A startup is a continual process, what makes on startup good right now doesn't guarantee future profits. Google and Meta led the AI/ ML industry before the 2020s, infinite resources never dictated the win due to allocation and underestimation of other domains. OpenAI was cutting edge in 2022, it still is but Anthropic seemed to have taken on coding 2024-2025. Github was a big aha moment for me when I first tried it in 2022, it didn't guarantee any edge over Cursor.


## Why People Matter

Mathematically, if startups are a process of constant innovation and being on the edge. If we think of the actions a startup takes as a sum individuals represented by Markov decision processes with new states. The only universally controllable common prior behind every action/ change is the person you hire. They might be self-evolving themselves, that's a contextual caveat, but picking the correct one for the process. 

### What makes a good founder?

There's an interesting interview between [Huberman -- Marc Andressen](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0qkK5lNuRFJq0o11Js5Hvl)

1) Technically Strong. Comparative advantage wins technology races, economic transactions are opportunity costs/ slight disassortative in the manner. Everyone builds on top of an almost a similar absolute advantage, it's optimal for your upstream suppliers. (Eg. basic access to LLMs and cloud compute is universal expectation in 2025).

2) Self-Conscious. Ability to understand nuance, high-frequency iterative self correction and alignment.

3) Socially Intelligent.

4) Directness, firmness, and clarity/ pragmatism of vision- People often say disagreability, however, I think it's inaccurate to it's cause. The ability to get something done even if people don't understand it why it matters. Admittedly this is hard to phrase. 

5) Grit: success in PMF or dominating the market works in a non linear manner when one hits a bifurication in the market or technology, the only way to build a strong market edge is to walk towards it for a long time. 

6) Optimistic: World is a positive sum game, usually the visionaries, Dell, Jack Ma, Musk, Page, Brin think of more of a world which could be bigger. Zero sum games have finite markets by their definition, negative sum has decreasing market size. History has shown quality of life over the long run progressively better since the scientific revolution, it's fundamental and obvious truth. Also continuous forward movement is a dynamic process more likely to hit optimal outcomes, being a continously a target for luck.

7) Creativity.

8) Solution oriented. Challenges are to be navigated not to label and worked-around.


### Some extras

9) Pragmatism. The only truth is the product, numbers, progress, physics. There might be a lot of conflicting idealogies on the way forward or on the what to do. There are many requirements, regulations, and conventions but where set for different times and different goals and purposes. This feeds as a factor self-consciousness too point 2.

10) Curiousity. 

11) Growth oriented. This also factors under point 2 too.







### Side notes and implications:

1) In social structures there's a strong positive assortativity of human interactions with other humans. Similar to collaborative filtering can best used to tell if a product is good between two friends. People want to work with people similar to themselves, hiring matters, founder matters. Non-linear effect goes both ways, smart people can hire their smarter friends and average people could hire people more mediocre than them, causing a non-linear decay in talent. 

2) In the [The Mathematics of Love | Hannah Fry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFVXsjVdvmY), Hannah Fry talks in the 3rd point about how avoidance of addressing problems/ suppression leads to suboptimal outcomes in multi-agent games from Gottmann-Mathematical equations. Analogously 2 Self-conscious solves internal conflicts, 3 Social intelligence and 4 are for in office, person-person conflict. Elon Musk was notably direct, however he was also socially intelligent to stay in good terms with the Founders Fund and people who ousted him out of paypal to later save his other companies 10+ years down the road. (Objective self optimization).

3) For point 4 above. And then there's the what if employees or senior managers try to influence the company in a non-optimal/ short-term direction? This requires exactly above, to know the vision and the be able to be firm. 

4) An interesting book [The Tipping Point, Malcolm Gladwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tipping_Point) which talks about the nonlinear effects epidemic spread of products or things which happen over night, with massive, wow/ aha factor. But before that it often seems like crickets for a long time. But by the topology how society works and inequality of weight of events which happens to us that's just what is true. (Nvidia, SpaceX, OpenAI). 

5) Musk once said the only truths are physics, question the requirements and why they're there.

6) For judgement and intuition growth 2 Buffett used to read a every single paper and catelog on businesses since he was a child. 
7) At scale, innovation is a mix of explore and exploit, curiosity. [Hyejin Youn](http://hyoun.me/research/#innovation). Biggest innovations are often the connections between two vastly different fields. Bezos and Musk and also Google run this style of innovation.

AI transition is confusing if you look at it from the zeroth order view, no one knows "what" is the future of AI what to develop/ invest.

But first order is more obvious we know we should learn AI related skills because they're frontier.

Second order has never changed, it's why the Stoics have lasted 2000+ years. Positive sum of technology over the long run is consistent. Dale Carnegie's "How to Win Friends and Influence People" is still on the shelves. The value in AI is not in doing but perhaps it's ability to learn and replicate, the value of AI talent is perhaps on teaching it how to meta learn better and better towards specified values. 


### How to spot technical founders/ or recruit a founding team.

Signaling on their side:

1) Has specific technical opinions/ tastes, taste is developped over time and from doing, the strong tastes signifies that they care or are passionate about it with the ability.

2) Consistent/ large scale projects finished end to end.

3) Reader, similar idea to technical opinions/ tastes, probe the depth of their opinions.

4) Self-reflective in conversations 

5) Constructive conversations

6) Comfort with directness

7) Draw towards purpose which seems fundamental and meaningful to a human

What a recruiter can do:

1) Conversations, relationship, read if the person writes. 

2) Read concrete history, what they've done exactly the projects and if they're followed through comprehensively (project based hiring, signaling is more accurate the resume based due to abstraction).

3) Learn about their field (20 hour rule) and probe their technical and specific opinions.

4) Self-Improvement. By assortativity of social relationships/ understanding the only way to meet, understand, and retain talent is by growing into this space yourself.

5) Learn about the people they surround themselves with, talent is highly assortative. 


## Why Vision Matters

If technology solves individual problems, once the process/ product is done with one problem a company has to decide where to go. Vision drives the continuity of innovation. Downstream effects on hiring.

# Caveats 

## Speed

Speed as in time to market matters when the end outcome is objectively clear, you know when you have a successful product when it does exactly XYZ. Industries: Automation, B2B entreprise/ management CRUD/ flows.

Talent matters more when your foundation is algorithmic, design, infrastructure, technological, or consumer taste ~ however, these are hard edges to win and requires consistency of innovation and taste, only provided by the people you hire. Lovable was by far not the first website/ full stack code free platform, neither was cursor code editor, Tiktok and Instagram not the first consumer tech products. TSMC not the first semi-conductor foundry, BYD the first electric vechicle.


# Conclusion
Fundamental behaviors and patterns of the individual and the aggregate of society never changes, there are a few clear constants to navigate by. The rest is understanding nuance. Success comes from navigating this nuance and complexity.
