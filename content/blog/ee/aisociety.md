## Intro

I've many qalms with fear driven reactions of AI. Will it replace humans, will it replace all workers? Is it the last moment in time to get rich (YC Startup School)? The First 10-person, $100B Company. The disappearance of seed funding. None of it seems logically complete. A short opinion is economics is human-centric, the markets is currently searching for a new stationary point (multi dimensional oscillating, after de-trended), economics works in comparative advantage with respect to transactions not absolute productivity, everything is relative to everything else, actually a beautiful equalizing factor of capitalism (when well-regulated) itself.

I'll give a couple null-models, thoughts and mathematical analogies with respect to each of them. Please contact me if you'd like to contribute in the formalism or give a critique. [My LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yi-yao-t-9719301a3)

At the end of the day, I think long run the world is positive sum and consumers are the ultimate winners of increased productivity and innovation which do well when they serve to reduce the asymmetry of flow between what everyone want and what everyone can have (over the topology and locality of the market). The consumer is the long term winner.

In a world with over-burdened workforces and demographic timebombs, increased labor productivity.

## Is it the last moment in time to get rich (YC Startup School)?

This often assumes that there are no more problems/ niches to solve. However, maybe one day Musk will build an intergalatic tourism agency and it'll only be for the ultra-wealthy. Then there'll be profits to be made for making it affordable for at least just the wealthy if it becomes advertised as the quintessential human experience. If we've not reached that yet and not solved that problem, there's still a whole space and much work to do before the economics stops.

Aside from that perhaps we're worried that one company will solve all problems with AGI and then no jobs will be left as the market works on comparative advantage.

So we ask ourselves: What about deep tech will a company run away with AGI? 

The world works in a cycle: one company has a competitive edge (eg. Intel) and slowly builds and expands monopology over pricing as it eats up the cutting edge for its full vertical integration. Another company comes in TSMC hyper focuses on the fabrication layer and beats it over a focused resource allocation and time, starting on very small niches (story of all startups) and becomes profitable. The same reason which leads venture capital to take risk in investing in the underdog is the same monopoly of pricing over the cutting edge technology which raises the pay out of the VC firms in investing in patience of another company to over take the first. Unless one company could dominate all of the talent resources, physical resources in the world, and have a dominant vertical technological edge monopolization, it could perhaps runaway through sheer force. Monopolization of technology is only part of a cycle before bifurcation. Thus competitors always have incentives to hire, more jobs will be made in tech, and thus: No, jobs aren't going to disappear. The nature of tech is layered and being industry leading will always require focus on it if the layer is important.

Easy example: Openai vs a gazillion competitors.

Actually, healthy market competition and capitalism is not to blame in the AI transition, it's also a democratizing factor that people would have incentives to create alternatives to a single model, hire people to solve more and an increasing diversifying set of problems. We just have to figure it out.

Finally, Human + AI > AI, unless the human is counter productive, philosophically the human can choose to run autopilot or do some creative or corrective procedure, now when everyone is standing on top of the same giants naturally made affordable by competition in free market tech, comparative advantage is what drives economies.


### Random secondary thoughts:

1) Buffett and Munger recommends picking only a few stocks to invest in to diversify one's profolio, when you start investing in the 8th or 9th or 20th diversification your taking money out of your most profitable revenue maker. Unless Openai can monopolize their talent resources which hasn't been the case, focusing on 5 core profit drivers is basic business sense. 

2) With point 1, why one company can't serve everyone with their single business model:

An example of non market monopoly:
We can start by playing with a matching game, there are 2 employers with one job opening each and 3 job searching candidates. We enumerate them 1 to 3 in honor of Matlab.

Here are their preferences of the opposing match
Employer 1 : (1 , 2, 3)
Employer 2 : (1 , 2, 3)


Candidate 1 : (1 , 2)
Candidate 2 : (1 , 2)
Candidate 3 : (1 , 2)

I can be a third party service with a employer oriented business model and optimize sending 1 to 1, 2 to 2 and leave 3 unemployed, and you'd say the employers are happy. But what if a new business model with a second service oriented towards candidate 2 and 3. Where 3 is willing to pay a lot for matching (assuming everyone has cash). The second service there for has the right to play and found it's market niche even though it's inefficient. This analogy aside, there can be multiple market winners solving the same market from different perspectives.

Ok but this assumes a specific configuration blah blah blah, in the end no one knows exactly what they want which is what AGI can't guess, even if so it modifying it's own input by guessing the first step would lead to exponential drift. And also talk about gender imbalance in population will mean that there is a configuration where dating apps will always be a market and locality of our interactions which there's like 1000 B2B same niche copies of each service like telephone, oil, electricity, gas stations, pharmacies, food chains in the world which can all be profitable at teh same time.

3) Vertical integration and choosing next development path is actually a more nuanced decision matrix. But for a 0.01% company, for starters: How important is this new market I'm entering going to be and how important is this new integration going to be if I want to continue to dominate my cash-cow market (assuming that it keeps growing)? And secondly if it's upstream innovation, deeper in tech supply chain, going from nearer to consumer to resource/ energy extraction (yes this is a hypothetical full range), are there any upstream suppliers b2(my b) I'm using that I'd be genuinely afraid of competing with and will they be better than me or can I hire and excute to be better than them? If not then move up the vertical.

4) A paper by McNerney et al. at Harvard's growth lab [How Production Networks Amplify Economic Growth](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.07774) found that technological improvements propagated along supply chains, "longer productions chains in an industry bias it toward faster price reduction". ASML makes a break through in their laser fabrication accuracy, TSMC makes a break through in energy and size of transitors, Nvidia makes a break through in Cuda, SK Hynix makes a HBM break through, Azure makes some massive load balancing saving algorithm, OpenAI benefits from all of them with a multiplier effect on each layer, hence why price reduction and progress in tech is exponential, specialization when allocated right, with correct talent and incentives, is a feature not a flaw. Finally, the consumer is the ultimate winner.



## We should fear young people not being able to find jobs in the advent of AI

Based on observation (insert citation here). Zuckberg once said young people are just smarter. There's a reason behind the Thiel Fellowship targetted towards highschool and university students and Y Combinator having a large youth demographic. Ok Perhaps just smarter is contextually inaccurate. In the renewal process of the work force, the fresh graduate labor force vs mature labor force actually is a trade off between the untrained but malleable and the well trained but for their epoch. Recently, many markets have heated up over the fight for experienced workers and cooled for inexperience. Perhaps in the technology bifurcation, people are waiting to watch what technologies get made, skill which are needed to hire. But perhaps its better to hire the untrained than the wrongly trained, untraining and retraining is harder than teaching, that of a previous technology status quo to figure out where the world is moving to next. It is true that the trained with new tools will be exponentially more productive in the current cases they're working on, however, the nature of technology is always premium of the shifting of comparative advantage not absolute productivity. 

Lee Kuan Yew noticed this in 1968 when he took a leave of absence in Harvard, he was told this by an economist, and from there he only meant to make the clothing industry of Singapore a stepping stone to manufactoring and that to finance, from one to another for Singapore. It's a process where each part is important the whole transition is important.

My intuition is that we should look over to the distribution the topology landscape of innovation and hiring instead of a top down generalization. At the same time the fresh labor force are the least productive they'll probably be the most creative, which is why of the heavy tail entrepreneurs, founders of Mag 7 started their first companies in their early 20s (consumer/semi-consumer) or for deeper tech in their 30s. Their naivet√© and creativity given hardwork is baseline for success perhaps gave them outlier results. But on the flip side talking about the most average distribution who enters the labor market to be hired, they definitely lose with respect to the trained during times of market uncertainty. This however changes as the status quo moves to the new equillibrium, in this case AI oriented architectures, and also education shifts accordingly and youth hiring will be status quo again.

In reality, perhaps that's why companies should hire a mix of both. But in a contextually aware sense, this person for that and that person for this, both specific and dynamic just like the process of business and technology.

## People focusing on no-code/ vibe-code replacing code or the one versus the other battle and the end of software-engineers.

The economy works on comparative advantage as always. This description is a very inaccurate way to frame what is important to think about. There's probably one foundational truth expertise vs. non expertise and expertise always wins, the basic argument is a no brainer and universal constant but with nuance to the previous section. Successful vibecoders understand what they're doing. Successful startups are hitting the correct new market and not trying to arbitrage old markets. If building frontend is cheap and we declare that engineers are needed no more and stop hiring people, then the Baumol effect will bring the pricing of our industry down. Hire engineers to solve new and intresting hard challenges and don't frame it as stop hiring to solve old niches, technology was never about that, at one point the cotton gin, the steam engine, the automobile were all cutting edge technology and everyone was interested investing in them. 

Yes AI means increased productivity and output and thus value per employee, at the sametime the scaling laws of companies will always arrive at a similar size as they're competing against other companies with the same base technology and not 10 years ago.



## AI will replace lawyers and law makers?
**To rewrite

In philosophy of politics there's Arrow's impossibility theorem.

Arrow's impossibility theorem states that it is impossible to formulate a social welfare function that satisfies all of the following three conditions:
1. Nondictatorship: The preferences of an individual should not become the collective preference whenever they are the preferences of the dictator.
2. Universal domain: The social welfare function should be defined for all possible individual preferences.
3. Pareto efficiency: If every individual prefers one alternative to another, then the collective preference should reflect that.

Well in short no matter what AI does if humans have heterogenous preferences even if they known. It probably couldn't decide on something through our ideal democratic process where everyone is happy

## AI selling to AI can be the future of the market:

**To rewrite

If you think of economics as a supply chain, at one point a higher level AI sells to a human which is where the profit comes from, economics is human driven. Perhaps the efficiency is where AI gives another AI what it directly needs (Gale-Shapely) again, obfuscation of performance at highly elastic markets don't change stable outcomes. SEO and GEO if they were arbitrarily optimized to get into chat rather than what a user needs, becomes friction that trained llm models will have to shrug off. In the end, focusing directly on your business brings the biggest dividends, with optimization for maximal information transfer. In the end your content itself matters. 

### Other thoughts

1) Bezos always said what is good for the customers is good for the company, perhaps many layers down even AI automating AI automating AI will fundamentally be based on human value.


## AI is not bad capitalism is.

A circle of chain effects:

Capitalism is the full cycle which keeps AI in check optimal resource allocation that no one AGI dominates everyone and replaces all jobs, because this AGI system would cost too much without drawing profits from being democratized and also drawing from talent pools/ educating the market which understand it. Even if it weren't democratizied, then the rest of society would just be left unchanged, it's like building a space colony on the other side of pluto today, as impressive as it might be, wouldn't have an impact on the world as we know it unless they make contact. Now with badly regulated capitalism, the system just becomes inefficient but then that becomes a national security threat, governments are naturally incentivised either regulate it better or be left behind. Thank goodness for the heterogeneity of the world.
