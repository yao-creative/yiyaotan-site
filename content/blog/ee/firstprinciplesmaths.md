Some of my theories and formalizations of what linguistic from business people computing tries to approximate.

1. Doing things which don't scale/ Good startup ideas: are startup ideas which have high uncertainty for others however low uncertainty but high probability of success for founders based on their knowledge. Not high uncertainty and low probability, because that's just absolutely unlikely. Innovation actually happens in a fractal branching processes how vibe coding frontend can emerge from combining the known need of website builders and control of technical infrastructure for future scale.

2. Presistence/ grit matters a lot more than talent: There are many dimensions of this because they all matter in contextual conditioning sense. However, the value of a company is a multiplicative random process over time. With 0 assumption on the distribution of each random role becomes log normal, however when one adds the fact that sometimes size just matters in the sense that reputation/ reliability/ trust/ customer to customer marketing is like a gravitational and self reinforcing multiplicative process which often times take a super linear effect on the quality of product which one has. Over time this creates long tail powerlaws as all of these multiplicative effects take time and continous exposure to luck in a sense that a random roll goes viral or takes a life on it's own in some branching process.

3. A startup is a process rather than an idea / product/ one hit wonder, similar to above, also the value of a company is the aggregate value of time of a self involutive process integral of t $f_{t+1}(f_{t}(x,t))$.

4. Customers are king: The only real measurable metric of the value a company brings to society is the value of transactions between the company and its customers which is upperbounded by value the company brings to the customer. Fuzzy value can be approximated by reveal preference theory.

5. Tech debt can have heavy effects on iteration speed (Stripe research): Knowing what you don't know is an NP hard problem similar to [Compression Sensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compressed_sensing) where one tries to approximate a higher vector space with a lower dimensional vector. Figuring out what one doesn't know takes exponential time (approximate because one can also read online), however, given a higher dimensional vector projection is polynomial time. A good hire in the moment lowers the uncertainty to what the company doesn't know. (Which also leads to the value of learning as an individual).

6. Hire the most talent people. It's well known that values brought in follows a power law. Exactly how much baseline hiring biases the distribution is actually polynomial based on the pareto distribution of expected return value as a function of X_min. [Pareto Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_distribution)

7. Don't focus on pricing. Precise value ratio pricing is impossible. First of all if one really wanted to do it they'd have to propagate the value of the company brought to the entire supply chain which is intractable and has aribtrary precision with compute time trade offs, not to mention lyapunov exponents and limits of time predictability. The best case is the resource was monopolized on the platform end. However being a horizontal platform, empowering customers actually creates branching power law processes of each of the individual downstream B2B which in turn creates higher alpha coefficients for the powerlaw of value chains starting from your business. 

8. Founders matter: Founders are the universal conditioning variable for a startup from start to finish, beyond that they are the ones who know exactly how the companies function the best by pure definition of them starting all of the initial operations of the company.

9. Founder-Market fit: One can say that the decision making ability is a function of uncertainty, and the higher mutual information or lower KL divergence between all of the founder's knowledge and the business operations the better and faster decisions can be made. This is in a sense is the comparative advantage of founder led companies and also often why copying other startups or competitors is hard, because the source node of dependency variables is different. The problem for tech startups is not between technical or not technical, however the "Comparative Advantage of lower Uncertainty."

10. Focus on learning: Due the the reasons of 1, 5, 9 above the goal of getting to a good idea is to find a domain which will exist in 20 years and walk towards that edge and gain comparative advantage and ride powerlaw process dynamics, PMF is the just bifurication when the activation energy (value of a product to customer > cost of customer using it both price and time and alternatives in a fuzzy sense). 

11. Moving Fast: Is the act of lowering uncertainty as quick as possible which leads to better concrete information of outcomes due to the limits of predictability and decisions made not as an optimal posterior goal.
