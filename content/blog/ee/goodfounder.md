# What makes a good founder?

1) Technically Strong. Comparative advantage wins technology races, economic transactions are opportunity costs/ slight disassortative in the manner. Everyone builds on top of an almost a similar absolute advantage, it's optimal for one's upstream suppliers. (Eg. basic access to LLMs and cloud compute is universal expectation in 2025).

2) Self-Conscious. Ability to understand nuance, high-frequency iterative self correction and alignment.

3) Socially Intelligent.

4) Directness, firmness, and clarity/ pragmatism of vision- People often say disagreability, however, I think it's inaccurate to it's cause. The ability to get something done even if people don't understand it why it matters. Admittedly this is hard to phrase. 

5) Grit: success in PMF or dominating the market works in a non linear manner when one hits a bifurication in the market or technology, the only way to build a strong market edge is to walk towards it for a long time. 

6) Optimistic: World is a positive sum game, usually the visionaries, Dell, Jack Ma, Musk, Page, Brin think of more of a world which could be bigger. Zero sum games have finite markets by their definition, negative sum has decreasing market size. History has shown quality of life over the long run progressively better since the scientific revolution, it's fundamental and obvious truth. Also continuous forward movement is a dynamic process more likely to hit optimal outcomes, being a continously a target for luck.

7) Creativity/ Curiosity. Innovation can only come from trying and building something new. This opens up the upper positive sum space-- [Nat Friedman: "Working on raising the ceiling not the floor"](https://nat.org).

8) Solution oriented. Challenges are to be navigated not to label and worked-around.


### Some extras

9) Pragmatism. The only truth is the product, numbers, progress, physics. There might be a lot of conflicting idealogies on the way forward or on the what to do. There are many requirements, regulations, and conventions but where set for different times and different goals and purposes. This feeds as a factor self-consciousness too point 2.

10) Growth oriented. This also factors under point 2 too.




### Side notes and implications:

1) In social structures there's a strong positive assortativity of human interactions with other humans. Similar to collaborative filtering can best used to tell if a product is good between two friends. People want to work with people similar to themselves, hiring matters, founder matters. Non-linear effect goes both ways, smart people can hire their smarter friends and average people could hire people more mediocre than them, causing a non-linear decay in talent. 

2) For point 4 above. And then there's the what if employees or senior managers try to influence the company in a non-optimal/ short-term direction? This requires exactly above, to know the vision and the be able to be firm. 

3) An interesting book [The Tipping Point, Malcolm Gladwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tipping_Point) which talks about the nonlinear effects epidemic spread of products or things which happen over night, with massive, wow/ aha factor. But before that it often seems like crickets for a long time. But by the topology how society works and inequality of weight of events which happens to us that's just what is true. (Nvidia, SpaceX, OpenAI). 

4) Musk once said the only truths are physics, question the requirements and why they're there.

5) For judgement and intuition growth 2 Buffett used to read a every single paper and catelog on businesses since he was a child. 

6) At scale, innovation is a mix of explore and exploit, curiosity. [Hyejin Youn](http://hyoun.me/research/#innovation). Biggest innovations are often the connections between two vastly different fields. Bezos and Musk and also Google run this style of innovation.
