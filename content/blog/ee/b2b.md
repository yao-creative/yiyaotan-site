# B2B Mathematics of why it's so sexy.

Sometimes people wonder if over investment of B2B is a bubble. Like why do people love it, why does Y Combinator focus on it. Why do all entreprises over the long term converge to it. I have four theories: 

1) Locality of information at entreprise scale, to build something and a fitting product for an entreprise is really hard and even to discover a tool which is perfect for the entreprise is really hard, communication is like square cube law if square was the surface area of the size of the entreprise, to route something to an entreprise which fits it will scale even harder, which signifies the importances of sales and stickiness of the product. 

2) Second of all, B2B technology is a layering process which is also it's process power, just because we have invented AI doesn't mean we don't need computers, servers, semi conductors, the logistics like ships to move them, trucks to transport them, power generators to power them, electricity grid to power them. None of the utilitarian industries done well disappear, however, the connect between the founder and the current social trend can fade away like the disconnect of a political party and it's youth generation which are always known to be the most likely to cause revolution or societal shift let alone consumer trends, think of it to be like exponential forgetting memory of society itself. 

3) Third of all, companies are path dependent, the longer a company solves problems in it's niche, the more sideway innovations it can sell: thinking AWS, Azure cloud, Google cloud etc.

4) Fourthly, it's mathematically efficient to empower other companies. If every company was mapped as a levy process and their accumulated value is like a gravitational effect, then the powerlaw is a natural occuring process by this propagating function. When one compound this by the chain of B2B processes (which can be modeled exponential branching processes which are each preferential attachment) which are all be powerlaw, the amount of value to give at every single layer is a multiplicative powerlaw process assuming that society continuous to grow. And since these long complex supply chains are like the growing phylum of a plant, as it grows itself more strain are put on previous layers, hence necessary horizontal growth of flat layer companies (eg AWS, Docker, Redis). Prices are only function of demand * difficulty of producing the service conditioned on the information discovery of the service on the local topology. There's value to be made everywhere since organizing the world's information is a communication problem which grows in a square cube law to the size of the frontier.



## Notes:
I'm not exactly sure of the scaling law in play, however it's definitely super linear, it could be fractional due to global improvements in techonology and also fractal dimensions are optimal ways to fit k < n dimensions of information transport in n dimensional space.
