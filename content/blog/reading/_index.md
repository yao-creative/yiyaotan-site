Welcome to the Reading section of my blog. 

Sometimes I read as a gateway to new ideas or culture other times I believe that reading can be for the pure experience of it itself. Someone once told me: "There nothing called shallowly-read only shallow reception." Don't be afraid to start reading- it's not important that we finish books cover to cover. I believe that as long as we get something out of it, we've fulfilled the author's original intent.

## Reading as a Gateway

I believe that reading is such a powerful way to condense years of experience, sometimes entire lives, and even thousands of years of intellectual discourse into a couple hundred pages. One idiosyncratic thing I do when I read is I always pick a postcard, sometimes related to the them and use it as a bookmark and then at the end write a note to myself after finishing a book. To myself it's like collecting a little moment in life. I was once told "there's no such thing as shallow reading, in the sense of lightly read in a literature, only shallow reception" and it is important to interact with the intellectual medium or reflect on what I appreciate. 

## Reading as an Experiential Exercise

I believe that reading for the pure experience is a good exercise in empathy, if anything to convince someone that one can gain something from pure fiction. I enjoy in particular rich descriptive literature for example some magical realism from Murakami or a good piece of fiction from literature selection prizes such as the Prix Femina collections as they bring upon a sort of "presentness" during the process of reading as the author takes you along in long night rides in the forests of Japan walk conversing over their favorite Trios (Kafka on the Shore, also my personal favorite is Mendelsohn's Trio) or when he sits you by a highway as you watch each car described with the personality of their drivers tumbling out of the freeway and to wherever they may end up (Par les Routes).
