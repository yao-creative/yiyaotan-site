Welcome to the Reading section of my blog. 

Sometimes I read as a gateway to new ideas or culture other times I believe that reading can be for the pure experience of it itself. Someone once told me: "There nothing called shallowly-read only shallow reception." Don't be afraid to start reading- it's not important that we finish books cover to cover. I believe that as long as we get something out of it, we've fulfilled the author's original intent.

## Reading as a Gateway

I believe that reading is such a powerful way to condense years of experience, sometimes entire lives, and even thousands of years of intellectual discourse into a couple hundred pages. One idiosyncratic thing I do when I read is I always pick a postcard, sometimes related to the them and use it as a bookmark and then at the end write a note to myself after finishing a book. To myself it's like collecting a little moment in life. I also cycle through reading multiple (up to 5 of different genres) to refresh my interest in a busy life. I was once told "there's no such thing as shallow reading, in the sense of lightly read in a literature, only shallow reception." I very much believe this as emphasis of interaction with the intellectual medium or reflection of aspects or experiences which one appreciates.

## Reading as an Experiential Exercise

I believe that reading for the pure experience is a good exercise in empathy, if anything to convince someone that one can gain something from pure fiction. I enjoy in particular rich descriptive literature for example some magical realism from Murakami or a good piece of fiction from literature selection prizes such as the Prix Femina collections as they bring upon a sort of "presentness" during the process of reading as the author takes you along in long night rides in the forests of Japan walk conversing over their favorite Trios (Kafka on the Shore, also my personal favorite is Mendelsohn's Trio) or when he sits you by a highway as you watch each car described with the personality of their drivers tumbling out of the freeway and to wherever they may end up (Par les Routes).

## Some Philosophies about how I read:

- "Not all books are for you, but there are definitely some which are" -- Books are like people don't let the ones you don't understand or click with discourage you from finding those which do, but the ones that you do you'll realize you connected with them more than you've expected.

- "There nothing called shallowly-read only shallow reception." 

- "Perhaps the goal of the Author is not for the reader to flip through their book from cover to cover, but that the reader might get something out of it, whether a learning direct or indirect, a message, an experience, or any enjoyment." -- More self explanatory, in Chinese there's this word call 收获 which can often signified something both concrete or abstract we gain, sometimes used to signify something gained from experience. I couldn't find a word which would precisely mean the connotations I wanted it to in English. This is also inspired by Walter Benjamin's "The Task of the Translator", where he explores how translations could be to shorten the distance between the "signifier and the signified."

- "There's no rule that you have to finish one book before the next." -- I used to think reading is hard, having thought of the point above. I realized that the stress from school to finish books cover to cover prevented me from exploring more on my own. In procrastination theory, they identify two main sources of procrastination, understimulation and overstimulation. I encountered the second, overwhelmed for the longest time to read for 7 years. I met a friend in uni who taught me this trick and sometimes you can catch me reading 4 non-fictions and a fiction at a single time, it gets the fundamental job done even with a seemingly blasphemous style ;).
