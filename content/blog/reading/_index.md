Welcome to the Reading section of my blog. I believe that reading is such a powerful way to condense years of experience, sometimes entire lives, and even thousands of years of intellectual discourse into a couple hundred pages. One idiosyncratic thing I do when I read is I always pick a postcard, sometimes related to the them and use it as a bookmark and then at the end write a note to myself after finishing a book. To myself it's like collecting a little moment in life. I was once told "there's no such thing as shallow reading, in the sense of lightly read in a literature, only shallow reception" and it is important to interact with the intellectual medium or reflect on what I appreciate.
