The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran is a 26 prose poetry by the Lebanese American Poet, the 16th most translated book in history by the number of languages even more Harry Potter and The Hobbit. Many elements of Islamic culture can be drawn from the way he incites many metaphors things such as “Life,” “Earth,” and “God” as an anthropomorphized universal guiding entity but it also contains a touch of more contemporary streams of thought. Al Mustafa is the prophet in the story and as he leaves the city of Orphalese the locals ask him to speak about different core concepts of humanity such as love, marriage, children, giving, work, punishment, laws, beauty, friendship, pleasure, and pain and many more. Many sequences of beautiful metaphors. Amongst my favorites:

## Giving:

 “You give but little when you give of your possessions. It is when you give of yourself that you truly give... And there are those who have little and give it all. These are the believers in life and the bounty of life, and their coffer is never empty. There are those who give with joy and that joy is their reward. And there are those who give with pain and that pain is their baptism.” 

## Work: 

“Always you have been told that work is a curse and labor a misfortune. But I say to you that when you work you fulfill a part of earth’s furthest dream, assigned to you when that dream was born, and in keeping yourself with labour you are in truth loving life, and to love life through labour is to be intimate with life’s inmost secret.”

## Buying and Selling:

	To you the earth yields her fruit, and you shall not want if you but know how to fill your hands. It is in exchanging the gifts of the earth that you shall find abundance and be satisfied

## Freedom: 

… I have seen the freest among you wear their freedom as a yoke and a handcuff. And my heart bled within me; for you can only be free when even the desire of seeking freedom becomes a harness to you, and when you cease to speak of freedom as a goal and a fulfilment.

## Teaching:

	If he is indeed wise he does not bid you enter the house of his wisdom, but rather leads you to the threshold of your own mind.

## Friendship:

	Your friend is your needs answered. He is your field which you sow with love and reap with thanksgiving… For you come to him with your hunger, and you seek him for peace… When you part from your friend, you grieve not; For that which you love most in him may be clearer in his absence, as the mountain to the climber is clearer from the plain. And let there be no purpose in friendship save the deepening of the spirit… For what is your friend that you should seek him with hours to kill? Seek him always with hours to live. For it is his to fill your need, but not your emptiness.

## Talking: 

	You talk when you cease to be at peace with your own thoughts.

## Time:

	Yet the timeless in you is aware of life’s timelessness, and knows that yesterday is but today’s memory and tomorrow is today’s dream… and let today embrace the past with remembrance and the future with longing.

## Good and Evil:

	You are good when you strive to give of yourself. Yet you are not evil when you seek gain for yourself… You are good in countless ways, and you are not evil when you are not good, you are only loitering and sluggard.
