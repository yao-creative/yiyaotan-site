## Intro

I've many Qalms with fear driven marketing of AI. Will it replace humans, will it replace all workers? Is it the last moment in time to get rich (YC Startup School)? The First 10-person, $100B Company. The disappearance of seed funding. None of it seems logically complete. A short opinion is economics is human-centric, the markets is currently searching for a new stationary point (multi dimensional oscillating, after de-trended), economics works in comparative advantage with respect to transactions not absolute productivity, everything is relative to everything else, actually a beautiful equalizing factor of capitalism (well-regulated) itself.

I'll give a couple null-models, thoughts and mathematical analogies with respect to each of them. Please contact me if you'd like to contribute in the formalism or give a critique. [My LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yi-yao-t-9719301a3)

At the end of the day, I think long run the world is positive sum and consumers are the ultimate winners of increased productivity and innovation which do well when they serve to reduce the asymmetry of flow between what everyone want and what everyone can have (over the topology and locality of the market). The consumer is the long term winner.

## Is it the last moment in time to get rich (YC Startup School)?

Ok but this assumes a specific configuration blah blah blah, in the end no one knows exactly what they want which is what AGI can't guess, even if so it modifying it's own input by guessing the first step would lead to exponential drift. And also talk about gender imbalance in population will mean that there is a configuration where dating apps will always be a market and locality of our interactions which there's like 1000 B2B same niche copies of each service like telephone, oil, electricity, gas stations, pharmacies, food chains in the world which can all be profitable at teh same time.

What about deep tech will a company run away with AGI? The world works in a cycle right: one company has a competitive edge (eg. Intel) and monopolizes pricing for a single vertical integration. Another company comes in TSMC hyper focuses on the fabrication layer and beats it over a focused resource allocation and time, starting on very small niches (story of all startups) and becomes profitable. The same reason which leads venture capital to take risk in investing in the underdog is the same monopoly of pricing which raises the pay out of the VC firms in investing in patience of another company to over take the first. Unless one company could dominate all of the talent resources and physical resources in the world, perhaps through sheer force, monopolization of technology is only part of a cycle. Thus competitors always have incentives to hire, no jobs aren't going to disappear.

Easy example: Openai vs a gazillion competitors.

### Random secondary thoughts:

1) Buffett and Munger recommends picking only a few stocks to invest in to diversify one's profolio, when you start investing in the 8th or 9th or 20th diversification your taking money out of your most profitable revenue maker. Unless Openai can monopolize their talent resources which hasn't been the case, focusing on 5 core profit drivers is basic business sense. 

2) With point 1, why one company can't serve everyone with their single business model:

An example of non market monopoly:
We can start by playing with a matching game, there are 2 employers with one job opening each and 3 job searching candidates. We enumerate them 1 to 3 in honor of Matlab.

Here are their preferences of the opposing match
Employer 1 : (1 , 2, 3)
Employer 2 : (1 , 2, 3)


Candidate 1 : (1 , 2)
Candidate 2 : (1 , 2)
Candidate 3 : (1 , 2)

I can be a third party service with a employer oriented business model and optimize sending 1 to 1, 2 to 2 and leave 3 unemployed, and you'd say the employers are happy. But what if a new business model with a second service oriented towards candidate 2 and 3. Where 3 is willing to pay a lot for matching (assuming everyone has cash). The second service there for has the right to play and found it's market niche even though it's inefficient. This analogy aside, there can be multiple market winners solving the same market from different perspectives.

## AI will replace lawyers and law makers?
**To rewrite

In philosophy of politics there's Arrow's impossibility theorem.

Arrow's impossibility theorem states that it is impossible to formulate a social welfare function that satisfies all of the following three conditions:
1. Nondictatorship: The preferences of an individual should not become the collective preference whenever they are the preferences of the dictator.
2. Universal domain: The social welfare function should be defined for all possible individual preferences.
3. Pareto efficiency: If every individual prefers one alternative to another, then the collective preference should reflect that.

Well in short no matter what AI does if humans have heterogenous preferences even if they known. It probably couldn't decide on something through our ideal democratic process where everyone is happy

## AI selling to AI can be the future of the market:

If you think of economics as a supply chain, at one point a higher level AI sells to a human which is where the profit comes from, economics is human driven. Perhaps the efficiency is where AI gives another AI what it directly needs (Gale-Shapely) again, obfuscation of performance at highly elastic markets don't change stable outcomes. SEO and GEO if they were arbitrarily optimized to get into chat rather than what a user needs, becomes friction that trained llm models will have to shrug off. In the end, focusing directly on your business brings the biggest dividends, with optimization for maximal information transfer. In the end your content itself matters.
