Perhaps taking the Complexity Economics view, I believe that aggregate macro-economic behavior should be studied in non-equilibrium dynamics and as a continuous time process and has emergent behavior from randomized boundedly-rational interactions of individual and heterogenous agents with differing valuation functions. Emergent behavior matters on individual timescales inspired from physics in nature: [Does Nature Break the Second Law of Thermodynamics?](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-nature-breaks-the-second-law/).
