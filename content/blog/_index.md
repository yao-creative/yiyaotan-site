Welcome to my blog. Some stuff are yet to be filled out. (The reading section is probably the most interesting right now). 

A lot of my life and economics/business analogies come from a comlexity economics view and I think are most interesting. It is important to keep in mind that the models and analogies used are to seen as "mean-field approximations," models which show understanding from specific finite modellable perspective. There's can always be a but this but that. But for the purposes of my writing it's impossible to infinitely parameterize and compress an accurate observation of the universe into a blog. But good writing is the ability to make complex topics simple without losing meaning (Accurate and Precise in conveying the message/mind of the author to the reader).

Perhaps I find most meaningful Paul Graham, Jeff Bezos, Buffett and Lee Hsien Loong because they understand the world both semantically, their applications, and finally from a formalism point of view which explains well the corest of principles thinking or higher order/ systems thinking (literally from the mathematical perspective).

## Categories fuzzy ranked with what I think are most interesting.

- [Economics & Entrepreneurship](/blog/ee/) - Thoughts on economics and a complexity economist view. I believe Heterogenous, Dynamic (even equilibriums are multidimensional and can be oscillatory), Adaptive, Boundedly rational at the individual level, aggregately (macro-level x time) positive sum, the microscopic level over large scale observations have patterns which are repetitive. I believe consistency, self-consciousness, short-term and long-term clarity and mid-term flexibility, accuracy and precision to concrete truth lead to optimal business outcomes.
