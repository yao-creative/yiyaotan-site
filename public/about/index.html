My name Yi Yao Tan. I usually go by Yao since I was young. Growing up I&rsquo;ve lived in 5 countries, a total of three continents and I&rsquo;m quite a diversely curious person for better or for worse.
I am currently pursuing an MSc in Mathematics and Foundations of Computer Science at the University of Oxford. Previously I graduated with a BSc in Mathematics and Computer Science in École Polytechnique (l&rsquo;X) in Paris.">

<p>My name Yi Yao Tan. I usually go by Yao since I was young. Growing up I&rsquo;ve lived in 5 countries, a total of three continents and I&rsquo;m quite a diversely curious person for better or for worse.</p>
<p>I am currently pursuing an MSc in Mathematics and Foundations of Computer Science at the University of Oxford. Previously I graduated with a BSc in Mathematics and Computer Science in École Polytechnique (l&rsquo;X) in Paris. My cohort was absolutely phenomenal.  My interests include Probability, Networks, and Machine Learning. I have extensive research experience in network analysis in supply chain reconstruction, transformer image segmentation, combinatorics, and high-performance computing.</p>
<p>Besides my work in mathematics and computer science, I enjoy playing in the orchestra and volleyball. I can get quite competitive for the latter but I&rsquo;ve also coached volleyball in my highschool. I love great conversations with strangers, travel, photography, and literature from various languages. Feel free to contact me on LinkedIn or fill the contact form!</p>
