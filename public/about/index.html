<p>I&rsquo;m the one on the left in the photo above :D!</p>
<p>My name is Yao. Growing up, I&rsquo;ve lived in 5 countries, a total of three continents.</p>
<p>I am currently pursuing an MSc in Mathematics and Foundations of Computer Science at the University of Oxford. Previously, I graduated with a BSc in Mathematics and Computer Science in École Polytechnique (l&rsquo;X) in Paris. My cohort was probably the most amazing group of people I&rsquo;ve met. As a regularly curious person, I&rsquo;m also passionate about personalizing, democratizing education, learning, and also breaking knowledge barriers. I&rsquo;ve dabbled around with research in network analysis in supply chain reconstruction, transformer image segmentation and NLP, combinatorics, and high-performance computing for distributed Machine Learning.</p>
<p>Besides my work in mathematics and computer science, I enjoy playing in the orchestra and volleyball. At Oxford I played for Hertford and Turl Street Orchestras. I can get quite competitive for volleyball, but I&rsquo;ve also coached middle school and highschool volleyball and enjoy teaching. I&rsquo;m quite a diversely curious person. I love great conversations with strangers, travel, photography, and literature from various languages. I speak Mandarin and English natively, I&rsquo;ve a working level of French (enough speak machine learning in the office and even to go on dates :P), studied a couple years of Russian, and now on an Italian duolingo streak of almost a year.</p>
<p>Aside from that, I&rsquo;m vegetarian which I believe is important to me as it helps me make conscious decisions about my health and what I consume on a daily basis and also fits with my world view aligned as &ldquo;sufficiency and sustainability as a consumer&rdquo; perspective. In my free time enjoy listening to music, often classical but other times diverse such as italian rap or japanese city pop. I also listen to a lot of podcasts and short book summaries.</p>
