This was unexpected.
An airline that forgot to assign a crew, a 57 Euro ticket from Rome to Riyadh, and 2 hours with immigration officers scrolling tiktok later, I got stranded in Riyadh for 2 days. Land of car memes and also the craziest and most fascinating people I&rsquo;ve ever met.
We arrived near midnight. Perhaps more than a hundred people from our flight missed their connecting flight. The airport was still under construction."><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.129.0"><meta name=robots content="noindex, nofollow"><meta name=author content="Yi Yao Tan"><link rel=stylesheet href=/ananke/css/main.min.css><link rel=canonical href=https://yiyaotan-site.vercel.app/blog/2023/07/living-in-riyadh-airport-for-2-days/><meta property="og:url" content="https://yiyaotan-site.vercel.app/blog/2023/07/living-in-riyadh-airport-for-2-days/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Yi Yao Tan"><meta property="og:title" content="Living in Riyadh Airport for 2 days"><meta property="og:description" content="Part 1:

Land of car memes and also the craziest and most fascinating people I&rsquo;ve ever met.</p><p>We arrived near midnight. Perhaps more than a hundred people from our flight missed their connecting flight. The airport was still under construction. 2 am, filled with shouting taxi drivers who even promised us a place to stay.</p><p>This German dude, 26, came up to us: &ldquo;Welcome to Riyadh, I&rsquo;ve been here for more than a week coming from Cyprus. What you need to know about the airport: there are two fast-food stores which sell basically the same thing. I&rsquo;m camping on the bottom of terminal 1 with other stranded passangers if you want to join us. Hotwater in front of the mosque to shower but you&rsquo;ll have to squat.&rdquo; He meant the &ldquo;wudu&rdquo; area, which he&rsquo;d go wash at night.</p><p>After talking to him. We found out that he bought 2 unsuccessful outbound trips over the last week. Got his phone stolen and lost his wallet and had been approaching random foreigners to buy him a ticket. &ldquo;My mom will paypal you.&rdquo;</p><p>Part 2:</p><p>Perhaps it&rsquo;s well known that one is 6 connections from any other person in the planet. We&rsquo;ve heard of the song &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a small world after all.&rdquo; But there is a lesser known truth from the same study where where people tend to live in highly clustered social circles. Echo chambers of homogeneity and magnitudes more amplified than one might expect. Storgatz addresses this paradox of social closeness yet pronounced segregation in a 1998 paper how human interactions are more than random but highly assortative.</p><p>Math aside, I thought I knew diversity. But through an interesting mishap, I found myself outside of my cluster.</p><p>Perhaps this will be the first a in a series of stories of people our (my) age. I met this Aussie dude camping on the bottom of Terminal 1 in Riyadh, 22 on the way back home, stuck for 5 days. He worked 3 years in a convenience store and saved enough money to travel. He spent 9 months biking from Rome to Lisbon cycling through 4 second hand bikes. First thing he did when he got to Rome was to buy a 50 Euro bike off the market. He&rsquo;d stay in hostels in bigger cities and hammocks near the beach. When he got to Gibraltar, he parked his bike and left for Morocco for a month. When he got back, he found only the frame locked to where he left them. Undeterred, he finished his trip with another bike.</p><p>To pass time, the German who approached us on the first night, 26, told stories of picking mangoes in labor camps in Australia during harvesting season. Giving hitchhiking rides to Aboriginals in the middle of the Northern Territory. He spoke fluent Spanish from spending 6 months in South America.</p><p>In the end, the Aussie bought a ticket for the German, they were leaving on the same flight. The second morning, we were surrounded by airport security as the German was caught stealing a phone from an airport security guard, but they let him go. I left the airport for the second night, got a taste of 40 degree desert nights. When I came back,all of the airport security were searching the terminal for him, regretting their decision of the previous day. My flight left earlier that day, I hope they figured out their way out of Riyadh.</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://yiyaotan-site.vercel.app/>&copy; Yi Yao Tan 2025</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
