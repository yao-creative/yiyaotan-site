      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;this-year-in-brief&#34;&gt;This year in brief&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Today I start a period of indefinite homelessness, staying at a friend&amp;rsquo;s place at Oxford, in a couple weeks with another friend in Hanover, perhaps beginning of September in Estonia, and then back for my thesis defense mid-September and then to who knows where else. Perhaps this is the sort of thing you embrace at 23.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been finishing up my thesis for Master&amp;rsquo;s degree in Mathematics and Foundations of Computer Science at Oxford. Writing about &lt;a href=&#34;https://yiyaotan-site.vercel.app/projects/economics/supply-chain-reconstruction/&#34;&gt;supply chain topology&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s been a year which has been a bit chaotic but full of turns and unquantifiable lessons about life. For starters I entered thinking I&amp;rsquo;d want to do theoretical computer science, ended up trying to enter the economics and statistical physics sphere with neither a degree in economics and statistical physics but crashing courses in Oxford&amp;rsquo;s Physics department with friends I&amp;rsquo;ve met in volleyball and revising with them for their finals to write my thesis on supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
