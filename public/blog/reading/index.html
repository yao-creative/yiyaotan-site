Sometimes I read as a gateway to new ideas or culture other times I believe that reading can be for the pure experience of it itself.
Reading as a Gateway I believe that reading is such a powerful way to condense years of experience, sometimes entire lives, and even thousands of years of intellectual discourse into a couple hundred pages.

One idiosyncratic thing I do when I read is I always pick a postcard, sometimes related to the them and use it as a bookmark and then at the end write a note to myself after finishing a book. To myself it&rsquo;s like collecting a little moment in life. I was once told &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no such thing as shallow reading, in the sense of lightly read in a literature, only shallow reception&rdquo; and it is important to interact with the intellectual medium or reflect on what I appreciate.</p><h2 id=reading-as-an-experiential-exercise>Reading as an Experiential Exercise</h2><p>I believe that reading for the pure experience is a good exercise in empathy, if anything to convince someone that one can gain something from pure fiction. I enjoy in particular rich descriptive literature for example some magical realism from Murakami or a good piece of fiction from literature selection prizes such as the Prix Femina collections as they bring upon a sort of &ldquo;presentness&rdquo; during the process of reading as the author takes you along in long night rides in the forests of Japan walk conversing over their favorite Trios (Kafka on the Shore, also my personal favorite is Mendelsohn&rsquo;s Trio) or when he sits you by a highway as you watch each car described with the personality of their drivers tumbling out of the freeway and to wherever they may end up (Par les Routes).</p><ul><li><a href=/blog/reading/the-prophet/>The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran</a></li></ul></p></header><section class=posts><article><header><h2><a href=https://yiyaotan-site.vercel.app/blog/2024/07/the-prophet-by-kahlil-gibran/>The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran</a></h2><p class=date>Jul 1, 2024</p></header><a href=https://yiyaotan-site.vercel.app/blog/2024/07/the-prophet-by-kahlil-gibran/ class="image fit"><img src=/images/oxford_spring.jpg alt="The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran"></a><p>The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran is a 26 prose poetry by the Lebanese American Poet, the 16th most translated book in history by the number of languages â€¦ <a href=https://yiyaotan-site.vercel.app/blog/2024/07/the-prophet-by-kahlil-gibran/>Read More</a></p><ul class=actions><li><a href=https://yiyaotan-site.vercel.app/blog/2024/07/the-prophet-by-kahlil-gibran/ class=button>Read More</a></li></ul></article></section></div></div></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://yiyaotan-site.vercel.app/>&copy; Yi Yao Tan 2025</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
