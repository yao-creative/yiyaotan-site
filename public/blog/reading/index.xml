      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran is a 26 prose poetry by the Lebanese American Poet, the 16th most translated book in history by the number of languages even more than Harry Potter and The Hobbit.

Al Mustafa is the prophet in the story and as he leaves the city of Orphalese the locals ask him to speak about different core concepts of humanity such as love, marriage, children, giving, work, punishment, laws, beauty, friendship, pleasure, and pain and many more.
