Perhaps this is the sort of thing you embrace at 23.</p><p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve been finishing up my thesis for Master&rsquo;s degree in Mathematics and Foundations of Computer Science at Oxford. Writing about <a href=/projects/economics/supply-chain-reconstruction/>supply chain topology</a>. It&rsquo;s been a year which has been a bit chaotic but full of turns and unquantifiable lessons about life. For starters I entered thinking I&rsquo;d want to do theoretical computer science, ended up trying to enter the economics and statistical physics sphere with neither a degree in economics and statistical physics but crashing courses in Oxford&rsquo;s Physics department with friends I&rsquo;ve met in volleyball and revising with them for their finals to write my thesis on supply chains.</p><h2 id=a-sense-of-agency>A sense of &ldquo;Agency&rdquo;</h2><p>Perhaps it&rsquo;s also just part being in our 20&rsquo;s. I believe that there are two types of people in the world those who know what they want to do and are deeply passionate about it and those who are still in the constant yet natural struggle of figuring out what they want to do with their skills. Deep down, I believe that perhaps it comes to the idea of &ldquo;agency.&rdquo; We want to find work where we believe that we chose it ourselves and it&rsquo;s our true passion, something which unifies our values and interests and where we can feel valued all together.</p><h2 id=passions-vs-sunk-cost>Passions vs Sunk-Cost</h2><p>Another caveat is that often times we misconstrue what we believe to be our interests and values with what we&rsquo;ve done or our background and are afraid to venture a little further and explore: for example me&ndash; an identity of being a researcher&ndash; which I&rsquo;ve been my whole academic life and spent a good amount of time sulking over in a degree identity crisis this year. Perhaps it is the sunk-cost-fallacy mindset and where I&rsquo;ve been afraid to make a decision and embrace a jump to try something new like start-ups which I might be better suited for as I&rsquo;ve started to realize that I&rsquo;m a better solution engineer than a mathematician.</p><h2 id=what-i-can-be-sure-about>What I can be sure about:</h2><p>In the topic of &ldquo;agency&rdquo; maybe I&rsquo;ve not found out exactly what &ldquo;I want to do for life,&rdquo; but I&rsquo;ve found that at each research project, solving a question, I&rsquo;ve always been the number one advocate of my project and fully immersed in trying to approach the problem in every way and shape possible I read hundreds of papers and a couple textbooks no matter the domain. Perhaps problem rather than domain oriented work is what &ldquo;I enjoy doing in life,&rdquo; and perhaps only the present matters and this is what gives me a sense of &ldquo;agency in the moment&rdquo; so maybe the surest path forward doesn&rsquo;t need to have a clear destination, just a good direction.</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://yiyaotan-site.vercel.app/>&copy; Yi Yao Tan 2025</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
