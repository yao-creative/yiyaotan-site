      <description>&lt;p&gt;Status: in-construction&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2025 seems to have brought a lot of confusion to the way tech builds startups. Perhaps vibe-coding and automation has made us re-question the need for technical founders. The short answer is no, nothing much has changed. Perhaps the exact action the what and what has, but the technicality of engineering has always been a universal constant. Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s shifted into deeper tech or more AI/ML based engineering and not the tradition apps that was true to be so 5 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Ai-Society. Math Perspective, Qalms about Fears</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve many qalms with fear driven reactions of AI. Will it replace humans, will it replace all workers? Is it the last moment in time to get rich (YC Startup School)? The First 10-person, $100B Company. The disappearance of seed funding. None of it seems logically complete. A short opinion is economics is human-centric, the markets is currently searching for a new stationary point (multi dimensional oscillating, after de-trended), economics works in comparative advantage with respect to transactions not absolute productivity, everything is relative to everything else, actually a beautiful equalizing factor of capitalism (when well-regulated) itself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
