      <description>This year in brief Today I start a period of indefinite homelessness, staying at a friend&amp;rsquo;s place at Oxford, in a couple weeks with another friend in Hanover, perhaps beginning of September in Estonia, and then back for my thesis defense mid-September and then to who knows where else. Perhaps this is the sort of thing you embrace at 23.&#xA;Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been finishing up my thesis for Master&amp;rsquo;s degree in Mathematics and Foundations of Computer Science at Oxford.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m the one on the left in the photo above :D!&#xA;My name is Yao. Growing up, I&amp;rsquo;ve lived in 5 countries, a total of three continents.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve recently finished a MSc in Mathematics and Foundations of Computer Science at the University of Oxford. Previously, I graduated with a BSc in Mathematics and Computer Science in École Polytechnique (l&amp;rsquo;X) in Paris. My cohort was probably the most amazing group of people I&amp;rsquo;ve met.</description>

      <title>Supply Chain Reconstruction using Hyperbolic Network Geometry</title>

      <description>Complexity Economics&#xA;I created a null model to replicate the network topology of Hungarian and Ecuadorian fine-grained (corporate-level) Input-Output Network Statics using topology induced by statistical ensembles distributed on a Poincaré Disk since they have been shown to exhibit real world network topology hard to recreate in basic random graph ensembles.&#xA;I used capulas to create powerlaw joint in and out degree distributions of the nodes.&#xA;The original reference paper can be found Oxford&amp;rsquo;s Institute of New Economic Thinking.</description>

      <title>The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/2024/07/the-prophet-by-kahlil-gibran/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/blog/2024/07/the-prophet-by-kahlil-gibran/</guid>
      <description>The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran is a 26 prose poetry by the Lebanese American Poet, the 16th most translated book in history by the number of languages even more than Harry Potter and The Hobbit. Many elements of Islamic culture can be drawn from the way he incites many metaphors things such as “Life,” “Earth,” and “God” as an anthropomorphized universal guiding entity but it also contains a touch of more contemporary streams of thought.</description>

      <description>Mathematics is not just about numbers and calculations; it&amp;rsquo;s a way of thinking that helps us understand patterns, solve problems, and make sense of the world around us.&#xA;In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll share my thoughts on what makes mathematical thinking unique and how it can be applied to various aspects of life.&#xA;The Beauty of Abstract Thinking One of the most fascinating aspects of mathematics is its ability to abstract complex problems into simpler, more manageable components.</description>

      <title>2 Days in Riyadh Airport</title>

      <description>Part 1:&#xA;This was unexpected.&#xA;An airline that forgot to assign a crew, a 57 Euro ticket from Rome to Riyadh, and 2 hours with immigration officers scrolling tiktok later, I got stranded in Riyadh for 2 days. Land of car memes and also the craziest and most fascinating people I&amp;rsquo;ve ever met.&#xA;We arrived near midnight. Perhaps more than a hundred people from our flight missed their connecting flight. The airport was still under construction.</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/projects/computer-science/sparse-transformer-attention/</guid>
      <description>Computer Science Projects&#xA;My most significant project, through a five-month research internship during my undergraduate at Huawei, I created routines for sparse attention in Transformers and tested their efficiencies on NLP data sets BERT model and image classification and segmentation on ImageNet-1k (100GB) with the Visual Image Transformer Segmenter. Created data pipelines, and evaluation metrics, worked on model design, started the transformer image segmentation library for Huawei, and trained models on Huawei’s Atlas 800 HPC clusters using the newly developed, parallelization-first ML framework MindSpore.</description>
