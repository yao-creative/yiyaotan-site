I taught myself from zero to full working proficiency in French in 4 months (enough to read Camus, play in a sports team, talk machine learning researchers, and even go on dates! ;P). Then I studied 2 years of Russian in French during my Undergraduate. I know a bit of Italian to joke around con gli zii (my teammates) quando giochiamo a pallavolo in Oxford and in Rome. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to learn to pronounce basic devenagri/ Hindi script, annoying my friend trying to read every single sign possible in Jaipur. I used to get by with Swedish in supermarkets thanks to my half-Swedish cousin and bits of Japanese, but I no longer claim to understand both. I&amp;rsquo;m currently learning Indonesian/ Malay so back to my roots. I&amp;rsquo;ve a spaghetti of words in my head these days, but if you have good book recommendations to help me ease into any of these languages I&amp;rsquo;d be interested : D.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>2025 Startup. Good Startup? Intuitions, mathematical perspective</title><link>https://yiyaotan-site.vercel.app/blog/ee/2025startup/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2025 13:50:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://yiyaotan-site.vercel.app/blog/ee/2025startup/</guid><description>&lt;p>Status: in-construction&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2025 seems to have brought a lot of confusion to the way tech builds startups. Perhaps vibe-coding and automation has made us re-question the need for technical founders. The short answer is no, nothing much has changed. Perhaps the exact action the what and what has, but the technicality of engineering has always been a universal constant. Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s shifted into deeper tech or more AI/ML based engineering and not the tradition apps that was true to be so 5 years ago.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dating, Gale–Shapley, Optimal stopping and Poisson</title><link>https://yiyaotan-site.vercel.app/blog/life/dating/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Aug 2025 14:32:06 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://yiyaotan-site.vercel.app/blog/life/dating/</guid><description>&lt;p>Often we wonder who to date: Will they be my life partner? Why is dating so hard in our 20s and 30s? The short answer is there&amp;rsquo;s no perfect matching for everyone on both sides, but most people don&amp;rsquo;t exactly understand their preferences anyways.&lt;/p>

 as a Null Model&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Gale–Shapley&amp;rsquo;s Stable Matching Problem serves as a reasonable null model with the most generic assumptions in a binary gender population and matching. Firstly, assumes two same-sized sets of each gender oriented towards the opposite gender and each individual knows exactly their preference ranking of the opposite gender in a discrete sense, maximal self information. For simplicity we write M and F as these gender sets.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>About Me</title><link>https://yiyaotan-site.vercel.app/about/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jul 2024 12:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://yiyaotan-site.vercel.app/about/</guid><description>&lt;div class="intro">

&lt;p>My name is Yao. Growing up, I&amp;rsquo;ve lived in 5 countries, a total of three continents.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently finished a MSc in Mathematics and Foundations of Computer Science at the University of Oxford working in the Complexity Economics group led by Doyne Farmer (Inventor of the first wearable computer, founder of the Prediction Company, and Econo-physicist) and supervised by Renaud Lambiotte (Network Community Detection Researcher - Louvain Method). Previously, I graduated with a BSc in Mathematics and Computer Science in École Polytechnique (l&amp;rsquo;X) in Paris. My cohort was probably the most amazing group of people I&amp;rsquo;ve met. I previously also did research in Huawei creating their sparse distributed attention library for NLP and Image Segmentation and Classification in the framework Mindspore.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Passion Projects</title><link>https://yiyaotan-site.vercel.app/projects/passion-projects/selftot/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jul 2024 12:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://yiyaotan-site.vercel.app/projects/passion-projects/selftot/</guid><description>&lt;p>Played around with Flask and Google API, maybe I can create some quick start generative ai app?

&lt;p>I created a null model to replicate the network topology of Hungarian and Ecuadorian fine-grained (corporate-level) Input-Output Network Statics using topology induced by statistical ensembles distributed on a Poincaré Disk since they have been shown to exhibit real world network topology hard to recreate in basic random graph ensembles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I used capulas to create powerlaw joint in and out degree distributions of the nodes.&lt;/p>

Many elements of Islamic culture can be drawn from the way he incites many metaphors things such as “Life,” “Earth,” and “God” as an anthropomorphized universal guiding entity but it also contains a touch of more contemporary streams of thought. Al Mustafa is the prophet in the story and as he leaves the city of Orphalese the locals ask him to speak about different core concepts of humanity such as love, marriage, children, giving, work, punishment, laws, beauty, friendship, pleasure, and pain and many more. Many sequences of beautiful metaphors and some which I believe are deeply true.

&lt;p>An airline that forgot to assign a crew, a 57 Euro ticket from Rome to Riyadh, and 2 hours with immigration officers scrolling tiktok later, I got stranded in Riyadh for 2 days. Land of car memes and also the craziest and most fascinating people I&amp;rsquo;ve ever met.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We arrived near midnight. Perhaps more than a hundred people from our flight missed their connecting flight. The airport was still under construction. 2 am, filled with shouting taxi drivers who even promised us a place to stay.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>https://yiyaotan-site.vercel.app/contact/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yiyaotan-site.vercel.app/contact/</guid><description>&lt;p>Pictured: Market in Rouen in January&lt;/p>

&lt;p>My most significant project, through a five-month research internship during my undergraduate at Huawei, I created routines for sparse attention in Transformers and tested their efficiencies on NLP data sets BERT model and image classification and segmentation on ImageNet-1k (100GB) with the Visual Image Transformer Segmenter. Created data pipelines, and evaluation metrics, worked on model design, started the transformer image segmentation library for Huawei, and trained models on Huawei’s Atlas 800 HPC clusters using the newly developed, parallelization-first ML framework MindSpore.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Compiler</title><link>https://yiyaotan-site.vercel.app/projects/computer-science/compiler/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://yiyaotan-site.vercel.app/projects/computer-science/compiler/</guid><description>&lt;p>
